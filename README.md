## Java Ethereum Tutorial
I will research compilers and the EVM
in the meantime, build applications around the Java client and a standard contract 
```
git clone https://github.com:extropyCoder/JavaEther.git
./gradlew run
```

Need to set up project then connect to private network
Can have a simple contract as an example
